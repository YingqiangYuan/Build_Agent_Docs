description: Read-only review of how completely a project's {{SOURCE_NAME}} configuration has been ported to {{TARGET_NAME}}. Scans both sides, compares them against the coding-agent-concept-mapping knowledge base, and writes a gap report to tmp/review-{{PORT_SKILL_NAME}}.md. Makes no changes to the project config. Use to audit a {{SOURCE_NAME}} to {{TARGET_NAME}} migration.

# Check port from {{SOURCE_NAME}} to {{TARGET_NAME}}

Audits a project migration from {{SOURCE_NAME}} to {{TARGET_NAME}} without
changing anything. It runs the same scan and mapping logic as the
`{{PORT_SKILL_NAME}}` skill, but instead of writing target files it records what
is missing or mismatched and how to fix it, then saves a structured review
report.

If the user passed an argument (`$ARGUMENTS`), treat it as the path to the project
to review. Otherwise use the current working directory.

## Read only

This skill never creates, edits, or deletes any project configuration. Its one
and only write is the review report at `tmp/review-{{PORT_SKILL_NAME}}.md` inside
the project. If that file already exists, overwrite it.

## Do not hardcode the concept list

The set of portable configuration concepts (project prompt, settings, skills,
custom commands, hooks, MCP servers, subagents, permissions, and more) grows over
time. Never rely on a list baked into this skill. The authoritative, current list
lives in the concept mapping knowledge base, which you read fresh every run. The
`../coding-agent-concept-mapping/...` paths below are relative to this skill's own directory in
the toolkit repo, not to the project being reviewed.

- **Concept roster plus each agent's primary file or location:**
  `../coding-agent-concept-mapping/ref/00-context-index.md`. Every concept it lists is in
  scope. Its per concept table names the {{SOURCE_NAME}} and {{TARGET_NAME}}
  file or location.
- **Detailed mapping and porting-in notes for one concept:** the detail file
  `../coding-agent-concept-mapping/ref/XY-concept-name.md` linked from the index, or invoke
  the `coding-agent-concept-mapping` skill with the concept name.

If a concept is not in the index, it has not been mapped yet. List it under
skipped concepts in the report; do not invent a mapping.

## Procedure

### 1. Resolve the project

Determine the project root from `$ARGUMENTS` or the current working directory.
All scanning stays inside it, and the only file you write is the report.

### 2. Load the concept roster

Read `../coding-agent-concept-mapping/ref/00-context-index.md`. For each concept, note the
{{SOURCE_NAME}} and {{TARGET_NAME}} primary file or location from its table. This
roster is never hardcoded; it comes from the index every run.

### 3. Scan both sides

For each concept in the roster, look inside the project for both the
{{SOURCE_NAME}} artifact and the {{TARGET_NAME}} artifact the index named, using
Glob and Grep. You are comparing what exists on the source side against what
exists on the target side.

### 4. Map and compare

For every concept present on the source side, open its detail file
`../coding-agent-concept-mapping/ref/XY-concept-name.md` (or invoke `coding-agent-concept-mapping` with the
concept name) and determine what the {{TARGET_NAME}} config should contain per the
mapping and the `Porting-in notes`. Compare that against what the target side
actually has. Consult the `{{TARGET_DOCS_SKILL}}` skill when you need current
{{TARGET_NAME}} specifics. Classify each concept as fully ported, partially
ported, or missing on the target side.

### 5. Write the report

Write `tmp/review-{{PORT_SKILL_NAME}}.md` inside the project, overwriting any
existing copy. Use this structure:

```
# Port review: {{SOURCE_NAME}} to {{TARGET_NAME}}

Project: <resolved project path>

## Summary

- Concepts present on source: <n>
- Fully ported: <n>
- Gaps found: <n>
- Skipped (unmapped or no equivalent): <n>

## Gaps

### <concept name>
- Category: <concept name>
- Present on source: <the source artifact found>
- State on target: missing | partial | mismatched
- What is missing or wrong: <specific detail>
- Suggested change: <what to create or edit, described not applied>
- Priority / impact: <high | medium | low, and why>

（repeat one section per concept with a gap）

## Skipped concepts

- <concept>: <reason, e.g. no source artifact, unmapped, or No equivalent on target>
```

Record every concept that has a gap as its own section. Keep suggestions
descriptive: say what should change, never apply it.

### 6. Report to the user

Point the user at `tmp/review-{{PORT_SKILL_NAME}}.md` and give a one line summary
of the counts. Do not apply any fix.

## Rules

- **Read only. Never modify project config.** The single allowed write is the
  report file.
- **The report path is fixed:** `tmp/review-{{PORT_SKILL_NAME}}.md`, overwritten
  each run.
- **The concept list comes from the index, never from this skill.** Re-read
  `../coding-agent-concept-mapping/ref/00-context-index.md` every run.
- **Suggest, do not apply.** Every gap gets a described fix and a priority, with
  no edits to the project.
- **Ground target details in `{{TARGET_DOCS_SKILL}}`.** Do not judge a gap from
  memory of how {{TARGET_NAME}} works.
